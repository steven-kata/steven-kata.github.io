          will be staggered by the paladinâ€™s attacks. The bigger beast looking monster is considered a boss type and will not be
          staggered. The boss monster has a variety of attacks, ranging from slow and weak to fast and painful. Maintaining a
          defensive stance against the boss is recommended. By using block, dodge, or skills that have a built in shield while
          attacking will lead to an action packed victory.</div>
